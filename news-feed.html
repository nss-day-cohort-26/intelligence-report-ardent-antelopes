            <p>
                There was a stabbing in Baldwin Park early friday morning. 
                Kyle Shanahan was stabbed thrice in the belly before a local jogger saw the incident and began to scream. 
                The perp fled the scene but is believed at this time to be one Jeffrey Dahmer. 
                Officer Jack Parker was first to the scene. He began to administer first aid until ambulances could arrive. 
                The actions of Officer Parker likely saved the life of Kyle.
